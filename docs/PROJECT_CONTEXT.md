# Project Context: Seniors Companion App

## 1. Project Vision

To create a user-friendly mobile application that acts as a digital companion for seniors, helping them manage their daily tasks, stay connected, and maintain their independence. The app will provide a simple, conversational interface for interacting with an AI assistant.

## 2. Project Goals

* **Initial Goal:** Develop a simple one-on-one chat application where seniors can interact with an AI assistant.
* **Core Functionality:** The AI assistant will be able to understand and respond to text-based commands.
* **Tool Integration:** The AI will have the ability to call tools to perform specific tasks, such as setting reminders for appointments and medications.
* **User-Centric Design:** The app will be designed with seniors in mind, featuring a clear, simple, and accessible user interface.
* **Scalability:** The initial chat app will be the foundation for a more feature-rich application in the future.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience is seniors who may need assistance with managing their daily routines and appointments. The app is designed for users who may have limited experience with technology and require a simple, intuitive interface.

## 4. Core Features (Initial Version)

* **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In).
* **AI Chat Interface:** A one-on-one chat screen for users to interact with the AI assistant.
* **Text-Based Interaction:** Users can send text messages to the AI.
* **AI Tool Calling:** The AI can interpret user requests and trigger actions, such as:
  * Setting a reminder for a doctor's appointment.
  * Setting a reminder for medication.
* **Real-time Communication:** The chat interface will update in real-time.

## 5. Architecture and Technology Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* **Programming Language:** [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
* **Backend & Database:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  * **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for user management.
  * **Database:** Firestore for storing chat history and user data in real-time.
  * **AI & Tool Calling:** Firebase Functions (or another serverless solution) will be used to host the AI logic and tool-calling capabilities.
* **State Management:** [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for managing application state in a robust and scalable way.

## 6. Design and Development Principles

* **Simplicity First:** The UI and user experience will be as simple and intuitive as possible.
* **Accessibility:** We will follow accessibility best practices to ensure the app is usable by everyone, including those with visual or motor impairments.
* **Clear and Concise Code:** We will adhere to the official Flutter and Dart style guides to maintain a clean and readable codebase.
* **Modularity:** The app will be built with a modular architecture to make it easier to add new features in the future.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** We will write tests for our code to ensure it is reliable and bug-free.
